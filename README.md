# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Kaggle and Google Colab

This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses a dataset from Kaggle and provides a Google Colab notebook for easy experimentation and analysis.

## Prerequisites

* **Kaggle Account:** You'll need a Kaggle account to download the dataset and generate an API token.
* **Google Colab:** A Google Colab notebook is used to run the machine learning model.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Download Dataset:**
   - Go to the Kaggle dataset page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
   - Click `Download` and save the file as `creditcardfraud.zip`.

2. **Create Kaggle API Token:**
   - Navigate to your Kaggle account settings: https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account
   - Scroll down to the `API` section and click `Create New API Token`
   - A file named `kaggle.json` will be downloaded.

3. **Upload to Google Colab:**
   - Open a new Google Colab notebook.
   - Upload `creditcardfraud.zip` and `kaggle.json` to the notebook's files section.

## Running the Project

1. **Open Notebook:**
   - Open the `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

2. **Execute Cells:**
   - Run each cell in the notebook sequentially. The notebook will guide you through the following steps:
   ```
      - Installing required libraries
      - Unzipping the dataset
      - Authenticating with Kaggle using your API token
      - Loading and preprocessing the data
      - Training and evaluating the machine learning model
      ```

## Dataset

The project uses the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a very low percentage of fraudulent transactions.

## Model

The notebook provides an example of a machine learning model for fraud detection. You can experiment with different algorithms and parameters to improve the model's performance.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository, experiment with the code, and submit pull requests with improvements or bug fixes.
